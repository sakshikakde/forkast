## A forkast of what's on the menu is healthy for you, served virtually!

Have you ever been in a restaurant, glanced at the table next to you, and thought, "Wow, that dish looks amazing—maybe we should order that!"? Now, imagine if you could see every dish on the menu laid out right in front of you in 3D. With Spectacles, you could browse a virtual menu, viewing each dish in realistic detail, complete with portion size and ingredients (no need to ask the waiter every time!). You can find "the one" that speaks to your taste buds. And in the future, this experience could be collaborative, allowing everyone at the table to explore and choose dishes together.

[comment]: <> (Forkast is an innovative augmented reality experience designed for Snap Spectacles, allowing users to browse a restaurant menu visually. With this experience, users can view every dish in 3D right in front of them, complete with portion sizes and ingredient details. Say goodbye to lengthy descriptions and guessing how a dish will look — Forkast lets you see it in realistic detail, helping you make your decision in a whole new way.)        

This project is built using Lens Studio, the platform for creating augmented reality experiences for Snapchat and Spectacles.

## Features
-  **3D Dish Previews**: View each menu item in 3D to get an accurate representation of the dish.
-  **CalorieTracker**: See which dish is best based on the calorie daily limit
-  **Real-Time Interaction**: Use gestures to interact with the virtual menu and dish previews in AR.

## Future-Features
-  **Ingredient Breakdown**: See a detailed list of ingredients for each dish in a user-friendly interface.
-  **Portion Size Visualization**: Visualize the portion size of each dish in relation to your surroundings.
-  **CalorieTrackerExtension**: See which dish is best based on the calorie count for the day
-  **Collaborative Exploration**: Future updates will allow users at the table to explore and select dishes together.

## How It Works
The Forkast experience is powered by Lens Studio's rich set of AR tools. The key elements of the lens are:     

-  **3D Models**: Realistic 3D models of the dishes are created and mapped to an interactive AR space.
-  **UI Interface**: A dynamic UI shows dish names, ingredients, and portion sizes in a clean and easy-to-read layout.
-  **Gesture Recognition**: You can swipe or pinch through the menu or zoom into specific dishes.
-  **World Mapping**: The lens uses the World Tracking feature in Lens Studio to place dishes on a virtual table in front of you.
-  The ultimate goal is to create an immersive AR environment where users can interact with a digital restaurant menu, enhancing the dining experience.
